There's only one implementation currently for Qt, this is the reason there's no other folder.

This implementation is still in progress as it needs to identify quantities. You can contribute or modify it to suit your needs.
The code is also quite messy, you can improve it
However, you can try this in your project, there are no problems encountered thus far.
