This folder contains the native C++ Implementation of Soul Configuration File Format.
In this implementation we use the library provided my akenotsuki, known as SRELL{std::regex-like library} 
which is a free BSD-Licensed regular expression library similar to the std::regex found in C++ but
this one has support for lookbehind and other functionalities just like PCRE.

Please checkout akenotsuki's SRELL Library here: http://www.akenotsuki.com/misc/srell/en/
